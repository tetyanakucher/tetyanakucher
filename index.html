		<p> Welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Tetyana Kucher, and I am a PhD student in the Curriculum and Instruction program at the University of North Texas. I worked as an ESL Instructor at Stephen F. Austin State University prior to starting my job as a Teaching Fellow in the College of Education at UNT. </p> 
	
		<p> My work involves teaching undergraduate courses at the Department of Teacher Education and Administration to prepare future educators for Bilingual and English as a Second Language Teacher Certification (EC-6). The main focus is on the issues of multiculturalism and explore topics related to diversity, inequity, and discrimination in schools. </p> 
		<p> I am also a lead developer and facilitator of the English Conversation CommUNiTy Program at the Intensive English Language Institute which is designed for the enrichment of cultural exchange international students, visiting scholars, and community members. </p>
