		<h1> English Conversation CommUNiTy</h1>
		<p> I develop a conversation club <strong>"English Conversation CommUNiTy"</strong> sponsored by the Division of International Affairs at the University of North Texas. This program is designed for students to meet people from around the world, practice English conversation skills for international students and scholars, and promote global cultural exchange and friendship. I design a curriculum for the program and serve as the lead facilitator. <br>

		<h1 align="right"> Multiculturalism and Bilingualism <br>for English Language Learners</h1>
		<p class="right"> I assist in redesigning and restructuring the course <strong> EDBE 3480 - Bilingualism/Multiculturalism for English Language Learning: Issues and Perspectives</strong>. Our goal is to make it relevant and up-to-date with the sociopolitical context of education in the American society. I implemented changes to the course structure, introduced new activities, articles, projects, and shifted the main focus of the course to match out goals. <br> <a href="http://catalog.unt.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=20&coid=75722" target="foo"> Learn more...  </a>

		<h1> American Language &amp; Culture Lab â€“ <br>Learning English Through American TV Series</h1>
		<p > While working in the English Language Institute (ELI) at Stephen F. Austin State University, I facilitated the development of the new course called <b> American Language &amp; Culture Lab </b> which focused on learning English through authentic American TV series. I developed the course structure, the selection of TV series, and a 3-stage instructional methodology to effectively teaching vocabulary, grammar, listening and speaking skills.

		<h1 align="right"> Global Gateway - <br> International Student Presentation Showcase </h1>
		<p class="right"> I coordinated the <strong> Cultural Experience Presentations </strong> program, formerly known as Global Gateway program. This program is a series of presentations on different countries by SFA international students sponsored by the Office of International Programs. These presentations are given by international students who share their culture and traditions, talk about everyday lives of the people, and speak from their own experiences. International students have an opportunity to share their cultures with others, while the public has a chance to taste authentic international cuisine while enjoying learning about cultures of the world from the young people who grew up there. I was responsible for the overall irganization of the events by recruiting international student-presenters, creating promotional materials and promote the event via social media, newspapers, emails, training the presenters on the program standards, serving as the event host, and resolving any organizational issues. <br>

		<h1 align="left"> English Language Institute (ELI) Games </h1>
		<p class="left
			   "> In collaboration with ELI program coordinators, I co-developed a program gamification system named <b> ELI Games.</b> The purpose of the program is to increase international student engagement with campus and local community and resources. I wrote the program policies, designed the reward badges and the official program mascot, and promoted the program through social media. <br>
