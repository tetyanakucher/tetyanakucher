			<dd>My work involves teaching undergraduate courses at the Department of Teacher Education and Administration to prepare future educators for Bilingual and English as a Second Language Teacher Certification (EC-6). The main focus is on the issues of multiculturalism and we explore topics related to diversity, inequity, and discrimination in schools.

			EDBE 3480 - Bilingualism/Multiculturalism for English Language Learning: Issues and Perspectives.
			<br>I assist in redesigning and restructuring this course to make it relevant and up-to-date with the sociopolitical context of education in the American society.

In addition to performing direct teaching record maintenance responsibilities, I also helped students with their cultural transitions, getting adjusted to the new life in the US by offering friendly advising sessions in out-of-class time to make sure everyone feels supported and cared for.
